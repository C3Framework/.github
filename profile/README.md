## About C3 Framework

C3 Framework is, at is core, a CLI build tool + TypeScript utilities, that allows you to create [Construct 3](https://construct.net) plugins, behaviors and themes, in a expressive and elegant way, without code repetition nor boilerplate.

With C3 Framework you don't need 10+ configuration files, you just write code, and from it, C3 Framework reads it, understands it and generates all the boilerplate for you!

C3 Framework features:

- Fully decoupled experience, you can structure your project as you want.
- TypeScript support for Behaviors & Plugins.
- A custom and intelligent parser that understands and compiles your code.
- Easy Multi-language support.
- SCSS/SASS support for themes, with color palettes and variations generation.
- Plug-and-play local server.

C3 Framework is meant to write the less amount of code possible, so you'll be surprised how quickly you start building your own plugins!

## Learning C3 Framework
