## About C3 Framework

C3 Framework is a set of TypeScript utilities and a CLI tool to automate the process of creating [Construct 3](https://construct.net) plugins, behaviors and themes, in a expressive and elegant way, **without code repetition nor boilerplate**.

With C3 Framework you don't need 10+ configuration files, you just write code, and from it, C3 Framework reads it, understands it and generates all the boilerplate for you!

C3 Framework features:

- **Fully configurable**: Structure your project as you need.
- **Highly-typed**: develop Behaviors & Plugins using TypeScript.
- **ACEs Decorators**: All the ACE config is done in one single place, inside the same code.
- **File scanning**: TypeScript definitions and File dependencies will be automatically detected and added.
- **Multi-language support**: With an easy dot-notation/Laravel-inspired translation system for all strings.
- **Themes**: Create your own themes with SCSS/SASS, with color palettes and variations generation.
- **Development Server**: Just run a command and start developing!

C3 Framework is meant for you to write the **less amount of code possible**, so you'll be surprised how quickly you start building your own plugins!

## Learning C3 Framework
